- Research Question   : Does tornado magnitude change over time?
- Null Hypothesis (H0): Magnitude does not change over time.

A linear regression of average annual tornado magnitude against year showed a
significant negative trend. The slope was -0.0155, and the corresponding
hypothesis test yielded p < 0.001 (p = 6.5 * 10^-17).

Because the p-value is well below the 0.05 threshold, we reject the null hypothesis
and conclude that reported tornado magnitudes have decreased significantly over time.

The model explains a large portion of the variance (R^2 = 0.63), indicating a strong
linear relationship.


- NOTE:
While the statistical trend is clear, this decline likely reflects changes in
reporting practices, detection technology, and rating methods rather than an actual
physical decrease in tornado intensity. Thus, the statistical conclusion and the
physical interpretation should be kept separate.

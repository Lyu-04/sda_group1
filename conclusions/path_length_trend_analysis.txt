- Research Question   : Does tornado path length change over time?
- Null Hypothesis (H0): Path length does not change over time.

The linear regression showed a small negative trend in tornado path length, with
a slope of -0.0273. The p-value for the slope was 0.00069, which is below the
0.05 significance threshold.

Thus, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that reported tornado path
lengths have decreased significantly over the study period, although the effect
size is modest.

The model explains a relatively small portion of the variance (R^2 = 0.15),
suggesting that the trend is statistically significant but not strongly predictive.

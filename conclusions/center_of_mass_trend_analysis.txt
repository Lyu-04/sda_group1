-     LATITUDE     -
--------------------

- Research Question   : Does the average tornado latitude change over time?
- Null Hypothesis (H0): Average tornado latitude does not change over time.

The linear regression showed a very small positive trend in tornado latitude,
with a slope of 0.00118 degrees per year. The p-value for the slope was
0.7396, which is far above the 0.05 significance threshold.

Thus, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no
statistically significant evidence that tornadoes in Texas have shifted northward
or southward over the study period.

The model explains almost none of the variance (R^2 = 0.0016), indicating
that year-to-year fluctuations dominate and the linear model is not meaningful
as a predictor of latitude.


---------------------
-     LONGITUDE     -
---------------------

- Research Question   : Does the average tornado longitude change over time?
- Null Hypothesis (H0): Average tornado longitude does not change over time.

The linear regression showed a very small positive trend in tornado longitude,
with a slope of 0.00174 degrees per year. The p-value for the slope was
0.6701, which is well above the 0.05 significance threshold.

Thus, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no
statistically significant evidence that tornadoes in Texas have shifted eastward
or westward over the study period.

The model explains very little variance (R^2 = 0.0026), indicating that the
observed east-west variability is dominated by natural annual fluctuations rather
than a long-term linear shift.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- NOTE:
Annual latitude and longitude varies substantially due to the geography of
individual outbreaks, changes in reporting, and randomness in where tornadoes
occur. The lack of a trend is expected and does not imply stability, only that
no consistent long-term directional shift is detectable.

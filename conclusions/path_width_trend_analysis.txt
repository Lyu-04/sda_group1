- Research Question   : Does tornado path width change over time?
- Null Hypothesis (H0): Path width does not change over time.

The regression analysis indicated a positive slope (+0.450), but the p-value
was 0.135, which is greater than 0.05.

Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no statistically
significant evidence that tornado path width has changed over time.

The model fit is weak (R^2 = 0.032), suggesting very little linear relationship.
